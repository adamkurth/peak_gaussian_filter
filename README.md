# Peak Detection in Crystallography Images

Detecting peaks in crystallography images is a multi-step process aimed at identifying significant points where the intensity indicates the presence of crystal lattice planes. Here's an outline of the comprehensive process:

## 1. Noise Reduction (Median Filtering)
- **Goal**: Reduce random noise without significantly blurring peak edges.
- **Method**: Apply a median filter to replace each pixel's intensity with the median of its neighbors.

## 2. Application of a Gaussian Mask
- **Goal**: Enhance signal-to-noise ratio and make peaks distinct.
- **Method**: Convolve the image with a Gaussian function to smooth the image.

## 3. Peak Detection (Local Maximum Detection)
- **Goal**: Identify potential Bragg reflections.
- **Method**: Use `peak_local_max` to find local maxima, enforcing a minimum distance between peaks.

## 4. Peak Refinement (Prominence and Width Criteria)
- **Goal**: Distinguish true peaks from noise and artifacts.
- **Method**: Calculate prominence and width for each peak, keeping those that exceed certain thresholds.

## 5. Extraction of Peak Regions (Using ArrayRegion)
- **Goal**: Analyze the vicinity of each detected peak.
- **Method**: Extract a region centered on the peak's coordinates for further analysis.

## 6. Analysis of Extracted Regions
- **Goal**: Conduct additional checks or measurements.
- **Method**: Compute integrated intensity, compare with simulated patterns, or perform other assessments.

## 7. Visualization and Validation
- **Goal**: Confirm detected peaks' presence and quality.
- **Method**: Generate visualizations and perform statistical validation against known structures.

Fine-tuning the parameters for prominence, width, and filtering thresholds is essential for reliable peak detection and requires experimental determination based on the specific crystallography technique, crystal properties, and image resolution.
